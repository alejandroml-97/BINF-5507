Here you will find the data and scripts for Assignment 1

The main script will import the "data_preprocessor.py" file as a module and will execute each function in order.
It will also show the accuracy of the model using the simple_model function.

Each of the "dp" code lines can be executed independently or together to see the effect it has on the "clean_data" Data Frame, which is a copy of the "messy_data" Data Frame.

If any changes need to be performed on the data_proprocessor.py file, the "__pycache__" folder must be deleted and the Jupyter Kernel must be restarted as well for it to take effect.
