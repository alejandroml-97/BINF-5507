Here you will find the data and scripts for Assignment 3

The main script has the DBSCAN, k-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms for the make_moons and make_blobs datasets in order imported from "sklearn.datasets" with the following parameters:

- make_moons(n_samples=300, noise=0.05)
- make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=3, cluster_std=[1.0, 2.5, 0.5])

The script will output the plots for each dataset with appropiate axis labels, legends, and titles for each clustering algorithm so they can be compared against one another and determine the scenarios in which is more convenient/advantageous to use them.
